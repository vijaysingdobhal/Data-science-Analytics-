# 🏏 Data Science & Analytics - Cricketer Data Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview

Welcome to the **Cricketer Data Analysis** project! This exciting endeavor focuses on extracting, cleaning, and analyzing data of Indian Test cricketers from Wikipedia. Dive into a wealth of statistics, including the number of Test matches played, batting and bowling averages, high scores, and more. With interactive visualizations, we aim to unveil insights into the illustrious careers of these athletes.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Web Scraping**: Harnessing Python's BeautifulSoup library to scrape cricketer data from Wikipedia.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting formatting issues, and ensuring data consistency for meaningful analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to derive valuable insights and trends.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating compelling visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to showcase the data effectively.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
- **BeautifulSoup**: The go-to library for web scraping cricketer data from Wikipedia.
- **Pandas**: Essential for data cleaning and manipulation tasks.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Powerful tools for creating stunning visualizations and plots.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Automated Web Scraping**: Effortlessly fetches up-to-date cricketer data from Wikipedia.
- **Robust Data Cleaning**: Ensures data integrity by handling missing values and ensuring numerical consistency.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Generate engaging plots such as histograms, bar charts, and line charts to highlight key statistics.
- **Version Control**: The entire project is meticulously version-controlled using Git and hosted on GitHub.

## 📈 Visualizations

Here are some key visualizations you'll find in this project:

1. **Distribution of Test Matches Played**: A histogram that illustrates the number of Test matches played by each cricketer.
2. **Run Distribution**: A bar chart showcasing the total runs scored by each player.
3. **Bowling Wicket Count**: A line chart highlighting the distribution of wickets taken by bowlers throughout their careers.
