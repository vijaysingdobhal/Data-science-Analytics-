Data Science & Analytics - Cricketer Data Analysis
Project Overview
This project focuses on extracting, cleaning, and analyzing data of Indian Test cricketers from a Wikipedia page. The analysis covers various statistics like the number of test matches played, batting and bowling averages, high scores, and other performance metrics. The project also includes several data visualization techniques to gain insights into the players' careers.

Objectives
Web Scraping: Scraping cricketer data from Wikipedia using Python's BeautifulSoup library.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, fixing formatting issues, and ensuring data consistency.
Data Analysis: Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to derive key insights.
Data Visualization: Creating visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to represent the data effectively.
Tools and Libraries Used
Python: The core programming language for the project.
BeautifulSoup: For web scraping the cricketer data from Wikipedia.
Pandas: To handle data cleaning and manipulation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and plotting charts.
Key Features
Web Scraping: Automatically fetches cricketer data from Wikipedia.
Data Cleaning: Handles missing values and ensures consistency in numerical data.
Interactive Visualizations: Various plots such as histograms, bar charts, and line charts to illustrate key statistics.
Git Integration: The entire project is version-controlled and available on GitHub.
Visualizations
Distribution of Test Matches Played: A histogram showing the number of Test matches played by each cricketer.
Run Distribution: A bar chart depicting the total runs scored by each player.
Bowling Wicket Count: A line chart highlighting the distribution of wickets taken by bowlers.
